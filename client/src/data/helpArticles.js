    body: "ResidentPulse helps property management companies collect honest, meaningful feedback from HOA and condo board members.\n\nInstead of traditional surveys that get ignored, each board member has a short, private, guided conversation. They share what's working, what isn't, and what they'd like to see improve.\n\nYou get a simple dashboard with scores, trends, and summaries — so you always know where you stand with your communities.",

    body: "Getting started takes three steps:\n\n**1. Tell Us About Your Business** — You'll have a short conversation where you share details about your company, the communities you manage, and what matters most to you. This helps us personalize the questions your board members receive so the feedback is relevant and useful.\n\n**2. Add Your Board Members** — Go to the Members tab and add the board members you'd like to hear from. You'll need their name, email address, and community name. You can add them one at a time or paste in a list.\n\n**3. Schedule Your First Round** — Pick a launch date and we'll set up your survey schedule. When it's time, you'll confirm and launch — and every board member on your list gets a personal invitation.",

Each member gets their own unique link — they don't need to create an account or remember a password.\n\nOnce launched, the round stays open for 30 days.

    body: "**NPS** stands for **Net Promoter Score**. It's a simple way to measure how your board members feel about your management company.\n\nWhen a board member starts their feedback session, they're asked one question: \"On a scale of 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend our services?\" Based on their answer, they fall into one of three groups:\n\n**Promoters (9-10)** — Very happy with your service. These are your strongest advocates.\n\n**Passives (7-8)** — Satisfied but not enthusiastic. They could go either way.\n\n**Detractors (0-6)** — Unhappy and likely to share negative feedback with others.\n\nYour overall NPS is calculated by subtracting the percentage of Detractors from the percentage of Promoters. Scores can range from -100 to +100. Any positive score is good, and above 50 is excellent.",

Think of it as one cycle of collecting input from your communities.\n\nEach round goes through three stages:\n\n**Planned** — The round is scheduled but hasn't started yet. You'll see the scheduled date on your Home page. The Confirm & Launch button appears when it's within 30 days of the launch date.\n\n**In Progress** — The round is live. Board members are receiving invitations and completing their feedback sessions. You can watch responses come in on your dashboard in real time.\n\n**Concluded** — The round has ended (either after 30 days or if you close it early). Results are final and you can view the full dashboard with scores, summaries, and insights.",

Good for getting a reliable pulse on your communities without over-surveying.\n\n**4x per year** — A round every 3 months. Gives you more frequent data points and faster trend tracking. Available on paid plans.\n\nYou can change your cadence from the Home page using the toggle in the Upcoming Rounds section. When you switch, your future scheduled rounds will automatically adjust.\n\nRunning rounds consistently is the key to useful trend data.

Each alert shows the community name and a brief description of the issue.\n\nYou can take two actions on alerts:\n\n**Dismiss** — If the alert isn't relevant or has already been addressed, dismiss it to remove it from your active list.\n\n**Mark as Resolved** — If you've taken action on the issue, mark it resolved. This keeps a record that you responded to the concern.",

It includes a brief explanation of what to expect and a unique link just for that member. They don't need to create an account or log in — clicking the link takes them straight to their feedback session.\n\nThe session starts by asking them to rate your company on a scale of 0 to 10. After that, they'll have a short guided conversation (usually 5-10 minutes) where they can share what's on their mind in their own words.",

    body: "Not everyone responds right away — and that's normal. To help improve your response rate, ResidentPulse automatically sends two reminder emails during each round:\n\n**Day 10** — A friendly nudge sent to anyone who hasn't completed their feedback yet.\n\n**Day 20** — A second reminder letting them know time is running out (the round closes at day 30).\n\nReminders are only sent to board members who haven't responded yet. Members who have already completed their session won't receive any follow-up emails.\n\nYou don't need to do anything to trigger these — they're sent automatically.",

Bounced members are sorted to the top of the list so they're easy to find.\n\n**To fix a bounced email:** Click on the member, correct their email address, and save. ResidentPulse will automatically resend the invitation to the updated address — you don't need to relaunch the round.\n\nIf a member marked the email as spam, you'll see a **Complained** badge instead.
